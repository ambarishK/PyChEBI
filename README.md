PyChEBI
=======

"Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is a freely available dictionary of molecular entities focused on ‘small’ chemical compounds." PyChEBI is a bit of Python glue to massage the *terrible* SDF file format into a Pythonic datastructure. For lulz, it also saves a gzipped, JSON serialized version of the database.
